---

## TypeScript Types

### Generated and Saved
- ✅ Types generated from live schema
- ✅ Saved to `src/types/database.ts`
- ✅ Includes all new tables, columns, and functions
- ✅ Proper relationship types with foreign keys

---

## Migration Safety

### What Was Preserved:
- ✅ All existing data intact
- ✅ Existing tables not modified destructively
- ✅ `electives` table kept for backwards compatibility
- ✅ All existing RLS policies maintained

### What Was Added:
- ✅ 6 new tables
- ✅ 7 new columns to existing tables
- ✅ 3 helper functions
- ✅ 4 update triggers
- ✅ 32+ new indexes for performance

### Rollback Safety:
- Each migration is independent
- Can be reverted individually if needed
- No data loss on rollback (seeded data would be removed)

---

## Next Steps for Application Code

### 1. Update API Endpoints
- Add `/api/student/packages` - View package progress
- Add `/api/student/enrollment` - Manage course enrollment
- Add `/api/courses` - Browse course catalog
- Add `/api/terms` - Get active academic terms

### 2. Update Student Components
- Package progress UI component
- Course browser with prerequisite checking
- Enrollment status tracking
- Setup wizard for new students

### 3. Update Validation Logic
- Use `check_prerequisites` before enrollment
- Validate package requirements on elective selection
- Term-based elective availability

### 4. Data Synchronization
- Call `refresh_student_package_progress()` after enrollment changes
- Update schedules with term_code when generating
- Set student.setup_completed after onboarding

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Added for Common Queries:
- ✅ Get student's completed courses: `idx_enrollment_student_status`
- ✅ Find eligible electives: `idx_course_type_level`
- ✅ Get courses in package: `idx_package_course_package`
- ✅ Check prerequisite completion: `idx_enrollment_student_course`
- ✅ Student schedule for term: `idx_schedules_student_term`

### Query Optimization:
- Package progress calculation uses WITH CTEs
- Prerequisite checking uses array containment operator
- All foreign keys properly indexed

---

## Security Model

### Row Level Security (RLS):
- ✅ Students can only access their own data
- ✅ Committee members have elevated permissions
- ✅ Public read access for reference data (courses, packages, terms)
- ✅ SECURITY DEFINER functions for calculated fields

### Access Control Matrix:

| Table | Students | Faculty | Committee |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| academic_term | SELECT | SELECT | ALL |
| course | SELECT | SELECT | ALL |
| enrollment | Own CRUD | - | ALL |
| elective_package | SELECT | SELECT | ALL |
| package_course | SELECT | SELECT | ALL |
| student_package_progress | Own SELECT | - | ALL |
| students | Own UPDATE | - | ALL |
| schedules | Own SELECT (published) | - | ALL |

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Prerequisite Validation
```sql
-- Should return false (missing prereq)
SELECT check_prerequisites('student-id', 'SWE481');

-- Add prereq completion
INSERT INTO enrollment (student_id, course_code, term_code, status)
VALUES ('student-id', 'SWE381', '471', 'COMPLETED');

-- Should now return true
SELECT check_prerequisites('student-id', 'SWE481');
```

### 2. Test Package Progress Calculation
```sql
-- Add some completed courses
INSERT INTO enrollment (student_id, course_code, term_code, status) VALUES
  ('student-id', 'QURN100', '471', 'COMPLETED'),
  ('student-id', 'IC100', '471', 'COMPLETED');

-- Calculate progress
SELECT * FROM calculate_student_package_progress('student-id');

-- Should show 4 credits in universityRequirements package
```

### 3. Test Course Browsing with Prerequisites
```sql
-- Get all electives a student can take
SELECT c.*
FROM course c
WHERE c.type = 'ELECTIVE'
  AND c.level <= (SELECT level FROM students WHERE id = 'student-id')
  AND check_prerequisites('student-id', c.code) = true;
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
- ❌ No section-level enrollment tracking (only course-level)
- ❌ No room/section/section_time tables (in main.sql but not deployed)
- ❌ No exam scheduling tables (in main.sql but not deployed)
- ❌ No faculty availability tracking
- ❌ No swe_plan curriculum table

### Future Enhancements:
- Add section-level enrollment (student_section_enrollment table)
- Implement room/section/time slot management
- Add exam scheduling functionality
- Implement faculty availability preferences
- Add SWE curriculum tracking (swe_plan)
- Add waitlist management for oversubscribed courses
