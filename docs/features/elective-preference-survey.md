# Elective Preference Survey System

## Overview
The elective preference survey system collects student preferences for elective courses to help plan which courses to offer in upcoming terms. **This is NOT course registration** - it's a planning tool.

## Purpose
- üìä Collect student demand data for elective courses
- üìà Help administration decide which electives to offer
- üéØ Ensure offered courses align with student interests
- üìÖ Plan resources and faculty assignments effectively

## Database Schema

### New Table: `elective_preferences`

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.elective_preferences (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  course_code text REFERENCES course(code),
  term_code text REFERENCES academic_term(code),
  preference_order integer CHECK (preference_order > 0),
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz,
  UNIQUE(student_id, course_code, term_code)
);
```

**Key Features:**
- Stores student preferences (NOT enrollments)
- References `course` table where `type='ELECTIVE'`
- Each student can only submit one preference per course per term
- Priority order (1-6) indicates student ranking

### Academic Term Control

The `academic_term` table has a flag: `electives_survey_open`
- When `true`: Students can submit preferences for that term
- When `false`: Survey is closed
- Only one term can have survey open at a time

## User Flow

### 1. Student Perspective

#### Filling Out Preferences
1. Browse elective courses organized by packages
2. Select 1-6 courses across all packages
3. Drag to reorder selections (priority ranking)
4. Click "Review & Submit"
5. Confirm submission

#### What Students See

- Survey term displayed (e.g., "Survey for: Spring 2026")
- All elective courses from `course` table with `type='ELECTIVE'`
- No prerequisite checking (commented out for now)
- Course details: code, name, credits, description, prerequisites

#### Submission Rules
- Minimum: 1 course
- Maximum: 6 courses
- Can resubmit/update preferences before survey closes
- Previous preferences are replaced on resubmission

### 2. Administration Perspective

#### Opening a Survey
```sql
UPDATE academic_term
SET electives_survey_open = true
WHERE code = 'TERM_CODE';
```

#### Closing a Survey
```sql
UPDATE academic_term
SET electives_survey_open = false
WHERE code = 'TERM_CODE';
```

#### Viewing Results
```sql
-- Top 10 most preferred electives for a term
SELECT 
  ep.course_code,
  c.name,
  COUNT(*) as student_count,
  AVG(ep.preference_order) as avg_priority
FROM elective_preferences ep
JOIN course c ON c.code = ep.course_code
WHERE ep.term_code = 'TERM_CODE'
GROUP BY ep.course_code, c.name
ORDER BY student_count DESC, avg_priority ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- Individual student preferences
SELECT 
  u.full_name,
  u.email,
  ep.course_code,
  c.name,
  ep.preference_order
FROM elective_preferences ep
JOIN users u ON u.id = ep.student_id
JOIN course c ON c.code = ep.course_code
WHERE ep.term_code = 'TERM_CODE'
ORDER BY u.full_name, ep.preference_order;
```

- Preferences help planning but don't guarantee course offerings
- System uses `course` table exclusively (not legacy `electives` table)
- Survey can be opened/closed per term independently
