# Elective Preferences Draft System

## Overview

Enhanced elective preference selection system with auto-save drafts, visual feedback, and beautiful UX using shadcn/ui components.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Save Draft System** âœ…
- **Automatic saving**: Changes are auto-saved every 2 seconds after user stops making selections
- **Visual indicators**: Real-time status showing "Saving draft...", "Saved 2m ago", etc.
- **Draft persistence**: Students can leave and come back to their draft anytime before survey closes

### 2. **Enhanced Database Schema** âœ…
Migration added to `elective_preferences` table:
```sql
- status: TEXT ('DRAFT' | 'SUBMITTED')
- submitted_at: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
- Index on (student_id, term_code, status) for performance
```

### 3. **Beautiful UI Components** âœ…

#### **DraftStatusIndicator**
- Animated status badge showing:
  - ðŸ”µ "Saving draft..." with spinner
  - ðŸŸ¢ "Saved 2m ago" with checkmark
  - ðŸ”´ "Failed to save" with error icon
  - âšª "Auto-save enabled" when idle

#### **SubmitConfirmationDialog**
- Beautiful modal confirmation before final submission
- Shows:
  - Summary stats (total selections, credits)
  - Package requirements status
  - Ranked course list for review
  - Important notices about survey vs enrollment
- Prevents accidental submissions

#### **Enhanced ElectiveBrowser**
- Status alerts for draft/submitted states
- Clickable course cards (not just buttons)
- Load existing draft/submission on page load
- Disable editing after submission (but allow updates before survey closes)

### 4. **API Endpoints** âœ…

#### **PUT /api/student/electives/draft**
Auto-save endpoint for draft preferences:
- Validates course codes and term
- Replaces previous draft (not submitted preferences)
- Max 6 preferences
- Only works when survey is open

#### **GET /api/student/electives**
Enhanced to return:
- `preferenceStatus`: "DRAFT" | "SUBMITTED" | null
- `submittedAt`: timestamp of submission
- `currentPreferences`: existing draft or submitted preferences

#### **POST /api/student/electives/submit**
Updated to:
- Change status from DRAFT to SUBMITTED
- Set submitted_at timestamp
- Allow resubmission (updates existing submission)

## User Flow

## Technical Details

### Auto-Save Hook
`useDraftAutoSave` custom hook:
- Debounces saves by 2 seconds
- Tracks save status (idle/saving/saved/error)
- Only runs when survey is open and not submitted
- Compares selections to avoid unnecessary API calls

### Status Management
- **DRAFT**: Auto-saved, can be edited freely
- **SUBMITTED**: Final submission, but can be updated until survey closes
- Survey close enforced by `academic_term.electives_survey_open` flag

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced auto-save prevents excessive API calls
- Indexed database queries for fast draft retrieval
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Client-side validation before API calls
