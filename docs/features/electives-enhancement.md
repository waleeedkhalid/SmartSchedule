# Electives Page Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the student electives selection page by removing mock data, integrating with Supabase database, removing the search input, and improving UI components with shadcn/ui.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Integration with Supabase

#### Created API Endpoints
- **GET `/api/student/electives/route.ts`**
  - Fetches active elective packages from `elective_package` table
  - Retrieves elective courses from `course` table via `package_course` mapping
  - Gets student's completed courses from `enrollment` table
  - Returns student's current elective selections
  - Handles authentication and authorization

- **POST `/api/student/electives/submit/route.ts`**
  - Submits student's elective course preferences
  - Deletes old selections and inserts new ones
  - Maps course codes to elective IDs before insertion
  - Validates student existence and authentication

### 2. Database Seeding
Added sample elective courses to the database:
- **Advanced Software Engineering**: SWE401-404 (4 courses)
- **AI & Machine Learning**: AI401-404 (4 courses)
- **Data Science**: DS401-404 (4 courses)
- **Cybersecurity**: SEC401-404 (4 courses)

All courses mapped to the `departmentElectives` package with proper prerequisites.

### 4. Type Safety
- Defined `ElectivesData` interface for API responses
- Updated `StudentProfile` interface to match API data
- Proper type checking for all API calls

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Used
- `elective_package`: Package definitions (University Requirements, Math/Stats, etc.)
- `course`: Course catalog (type = 'ELECTIVE')
- `package_course`: Many-to-many mapping between packages and courses
- `enrollment`: Student course completion tracking
- `student_electives`: Student elective preferences storage

### Features Preserved
- ✅ Priority ranking system
- ✅ Package requirement validation
- ✅ Prerequisite checking
- ✅ Credit hour tracking
- ✅ Selection panel with drag indicators
- ✅ Package progress indicators
- ✅ Maximum selections limit

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Better Navigation**: Tab-based browsing is more intuitive than filter badges
2. **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced selected state with gradients and badges
3. **Information Hierarchy**: Clear presentation of prerequisites and eligibility
4. **Responsive Design**: Maintained mobile-first approach with grid layouts
5. **Accessibility**: Proper button states and disabled handling

## Benefits
