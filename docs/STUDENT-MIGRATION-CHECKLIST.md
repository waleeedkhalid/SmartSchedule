## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Work)

### Database Integration

- [ ] Create Supabase tables

  - [ ] `students` table
  - [ ] `elective_packages` table
  - [ ] `courses` table
  - [ ] `elective_submissions` table
  - [ ] `schedules` table
  - [ ] `feedback` table

- [ ] Replace mock data

  - [ ] `mockElectivePackages` → Supabase query
  - [ ] `mockSWECurriculum` → Supabase query
  - [ ] Student data → Fetch from `students` table

- [ ] API endpoints
  - [ ] GET `/api/student/profile` - Fetch student data
  - [ ] PATCH `/api/student/profile` - Update profile
  - [ ] GET `/api/electives` - Fetch available electives
  - [ ] GET `/api/student/submissions` - Fetch submission history
  - [ ] DELETE `/api/electives/submit/:id` - Delete submission (before deadline)

### Schedule Implementation

- [ ] Fetch actual schedule data
- [ ] Display weekly timetable grid
- [ ] Show exam schedule
- [ ] Export to PDF/iCal

### Enhanced Features

- [ ] Email notifications on submission
- [ ] Submission history view
- [ ] Edit submissions (before deadline)
- [ ] Real-time preference statistics
- [ ] Course descriptions and syllabi
- [ ] Faculty contact information

### Committee Integration

- [ ] Committee dashboard to view all submissions
- [ ] Analytics and reporting
- [ ] Export submissions to CSV/Excel
- [ ] Manual approval/rejection workflow
