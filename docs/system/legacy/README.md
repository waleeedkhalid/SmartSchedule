## Why Legacy?

These files have been moved to legacy because:

1. **Superseded** - Information is now maintained in auto-generated docs
2. **Outdated** - May not reflect current system state
3. **Refactoring Complete** - Historical refactoring documentation
4. **Consolidated** - Information merged into new doc structure

---

- May be useful to understand past decisions

**For auditors:**
