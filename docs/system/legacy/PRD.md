# ðŸ§© **SmartSchedule â€” Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

_Departmental Academic Timetabling and Load Assignment System_
**Course:** SWE481 â€“ Advanced Web Applications Engineering
**Institution:** King Saud University â€” Software Engineering Department

---

## **1. Product Overview**

**SmartSchedule** aims to streamline course scheduling, faculty load assignments, and student elective preferences exclusively for the **Software Engineering Department (SWE)** by providing a **role-based web platform** that automates conflict resolution and enhances academic planning efficiency.

It focuses on SWE-specific courses while treating **non-SWE courses as external dependencies**, ensuring no time or exam conflicts across departments.

The platform leverages **Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, TailwindCSS, and Yjs** to offer a responsive and collaborative experience.

### **Scheduling Lifecycle**

1. **Scheduling Committee** imports external courses (non-SWE), generates the initial SWE schedule, and launches elective surveys.
2. **Teaching Load Committee** reviews and adjusts faculty assignments without harming irregular studentsâ€™ course paths.
3. **Registrar** manages irregular students and registration overrides.
4. **Faculty** review schedules and provide feedback.
5. **Students** view schedules, choose electives, and self-register when capacity allows and no time conflict exists.
6. **System** regenerates and finalizes schedules based on feedback.

## **5. System Architecture**

### **Overview**

SmartSchedule follows a **three-tier architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer:**

   - Next.js 15 + shadcn/ui for responsive, component-based UIs.
   - Zustand for lightweight global state management.

2. **Application Layer:**

   - API routes for schedule, feedback, and rule management.
   - Logic for conflict resolution, load balancing, and data validation.

3. **Data Layer:**

   - Supabase (PostgreSQL) with tables for Users, Courses, Sections, Rules, Feedback, and Schedules.
   - In-memory JSON during prototype testing phase.

### **Real-Time & Versioning**

- **Yjs** enables live collaborative edits.
- **jsondiffpatch** maintains full history and supports rollback.

### **AI Component (Phase 3+)**

- Optional integration with **Google AI API** for generating recommended timetables based on constraints and feedback history.
