# Student Core Application - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This is the **production implementation** of the student elective selection system, integrated into the main SmartSchedule application. Unlike the demo version, this core implementation:

- ✅ Uses real Supabase authentication (`useAuth` hook)
- ✅ Redirects unauthenticated users to homepage
- ✅ Provides complete student dashboard with navigation
- ✅ Integrates with existing auth system and components
- ✅ Production-ready pages (not demo)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Access the Application

After logging in with Supabase auth:

1. **Homepage** (`/`) → Shows 3 cards for authenticated users:

   - **My Dashboard** → `/student` (main dashboard)
   - **Elective Selection** → `/student/electives` (highlighted)
   - **My Schedule** → `/student/schedule`

2. **Student Dashboard** (`/student`) → Central hub with:
   - Quick stats (Student ID, Level, Preferences status)
   - Action cards for all student features
   - Important notices and alerts

### 2. Navigation Flow

```
Homepage (/)
└── [Login with Supabase]
    └── Student Dashboard (/student)
        ├── Elective Selection (/student/electives)
        │   ├── Browse courses
        │   ├── Select & rank
        │   ├── Review & submit
        │   └── Success confirmation
        ├── My Schedule (/student/schedule)
        ├── Feedback (/student/feedback)
        └── Profile (/student/profile)
```

## 📋 Features

### Student Dashboard (`/student`)

- **Quick Stats Cards**: Student ID, Current Level, Preferences Status
- **Action Cards**: Links to all major features
- **Important Notices**: Alerts for pending actions (e.g., elective selection)
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Works on mobile, tablet, desktop

### Elective Selection (`/student/electives`)

- **Authentication Guard**: Redirects to homepage if not logged in
- **Session Integration**: Uses real user data from `useAuth` hook
- **Complete Flow**:
  1. Browse elective packages and courses
  2. Search, filter, and check eligibility
  3. Select and rank courses (drag-and-drop reordering)
  4. Review selections in confirmation dialog
  5. Submit to API (`/api/electives/submit`)
  6. View success screen with submission ID

### My Schedule (`/student/schedule`)

- View course schedule (placeholder - shows "not available" message)
- Exam dates display
- Integration point for actual schedule API

### Feedback (`/student/feedback`)

- Simple textarea form
- Submit feedback about schedule
- Success confirmation

### Profile (`/student/profile`)

- Personal information display
- Academic progress (GPA, credits, level)
- Sign out action

## 🔐 Authentication Integration

All student pages use the existing Supabase auth system:

```tsx
import { useAuth } from "@/components/auth/use-auth";

export default function StudentPage() {
  const { user, isLoading } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isLoading && !user) {
      router.push("/"); // Redirect to homepage
    }
  }, [user, isLoading, router]);

  // Rest of component...
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Uses `isLoading` property (not `loading`)
- Redirects unauthenticated users to homepage
- Extracts student data from `user` object:
  - `user.email` → Student ID
  - `user.user_metadata?.full_name` → Name
  - More fields can be added to Supabase user metadata

---

## 🎨 Component Reuse

The elective selection pages reuse all components from the demo:

```tsx
import {
  ElectiveBrowser,
  ReviewSubmitDialog,
  SubmissionSuccess,
  SelectedCourse,
} from "@/components/student/electives";
```

**No changes needed** to these components - they work in both demo and production contexts.

---

## 🔗 API Integration

### Elective Submission Endpoint

**POST** `/api/electives/submit`

```json
{
  "studentId": "441000001",
  "selections": [
    {
      "packageId": "pkg1",
      "courseCode": "SWE311",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "submissionId": "SUB-1234567890",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**GET** `/api/electives/submit?studentId=441000001`

Returns all submissions for a student.

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: `http://localhost:3000`

### Testing Flow

1. **Login** with Supabase auth (email/password)
2. **Navigate** to student dashboard (`/student`)
3. **Click** "Elective Course Selection"
4. **Browse** courses, select at least 1 from each package
5. **Rank** selections using up/down arrows
6. **Submit** and verify success screen
7. **Check** submission in API response

### Mock Data

Currently uses mock data from:

- `/src/data/mockData.ts` → `mockElectivePackages`
- `/src/data/mockSWECurriculum.ts` → Course definitions

Replace with real Supabase queries when ready.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Property 'loading' does not exist on type 'AuthContextValue'"

**Solution:** Use `isLoading` instead:

```tsx
const { user, isLoading } = useAuth(); // ✅ Correct
const { user, loading } = useAuth(); // ❌ Wrong
```

### "User redirected to homepage immediately"

**Check:**

1. Is Supabase auth configured correctly?
2. Is user actually logged in?
3. Check `AuthProvider` in `src/app/providers.tsx`
4. Verify `useAuth` hook returns user object

### "Components not found"

**Check:**

1. Components are in `/src/components/student/electives/`
2. `index.ts` exports all components
3. Import path uses `@/components/student/electives`
