## Priority Weights

Configurable weights for schedule optimization (must sum to 1.0):

**Default Weights:**
```json
{
  "time_preference": 0.2,
  "faculty_preference": 0.2,
  "elective_preference": 0.15,
  "minimize_gaps": 0.15,
  "room_optimization": 0.15,
  "load_balancing": 0.15
}
```

## Conflict Detection

### Severity Levels
- **Critical** - Must be resolved (e.g., room double-booking)
- **Error** - Should be fixed (e.g., capacity exceeded)
- **Warning** - Review recommended (e.g., under-enrollment)
- **Info** - Informational notices

### Conflict Types
- Time overlap
- Exam overlap
- Capacity exceeded
- Prerequisite violation
- Room conflict
- Faculty conflict
- Constraint violation
- Elective unavailable
- Excessive daily/weekly load
- Large gaps
- Faculty unavailable
- Missing required course

2. Fetch current/default configuration
3. User modifies rules or weights
4. Client-side validation
5. Test rules against schedule (optional)
6. Save configuration to database
7. Configuration used in schedule generation

## Integration Points

### Schedule Generator
