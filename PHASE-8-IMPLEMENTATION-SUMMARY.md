## 🔌 API Integration

### Endpoint
`GET /api/committee/scheduler/student-counts`

### Parameters
- `term_code` (required): Academic term identifier
- `group_by` (optional): 'course' | 'level' | 'course_type'

### Data Sources
- `enrollment` table
- `students` table
- `course` table
- `elective_preferences` table
- `get_course_enrollment_stats()` function

---

## 💾 Database Integration

### Tables Used
```sql
-- Core enrollment data
enrollment (student_id, course_code, term_code, status)

-- Student information
students (id, level, student_number)

-- Course details
course (code, name, type, level, credits)

-- Preference tracking
elective_preferences (student_id, course_code, preference_order, term_code)

-- Term configuration
academic_term (code, name, is_active)
```

### Functions Used
```sql
get_course_enrollment_stats(p_term_code TEXT)
-- Returns enrollment statistics by course
```

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

### Design Principles
- **Consistency**: Matches existing scheduler component patterns
- **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and information architecture
- **Efficiency**: Quick access to critical data via filters
- **Feedback**: Clear status indicators and loading states

### Color Coding
- 🔴 **Red**: Over capacity (>100%) - Critical
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Near capacity (90-100%) - Warning
- 🟢 **Green**: Normal capacity (50-90%) - OK
- ⚪ **Gray**: Under-utilized (<50%) - Low

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: Single column, stacked filters
- Tablet: 2-column grid, side-by-side filters
- Desktop: Full grid, inline filters
