### 5. Integration with Schedule Generation

#### Updated: schedule/generate/page.tsx

**New Features:**
- ✅ Conflict resolution state management
- ✅ Re-validation after resolution
- ✅ Integration with ConflictResolver component
- ✅ Auto-resolve all functionality
- ✅ Manual resolution with dialog
- ✅ Real-time conflict updates

**Workflow:**
1. Generate schedule → Detect conflicts
2. View conflicts in dedicated tab
3. Select conflict → Choose resolution (auto/manual)
4. Apply resolution → Re-validate
5. Continue until all conflicts resolved

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
1. Schedule Generation
   ↓
2. Conflict Detection (ConflictChecker)
   ↓
3. Display Conflicts (ConflictResolver UI)
   ↓
4. User Action (Auto or Manual)
   ↓
5. Generate Suggestions (ConflictResolutionEngine)
   ↓
6. Apply Resolution (API)
   ↓
7. Update Database
   ↓
8. Re-validate (Loop to step 2)
```

### Type System

**Core Types:**
```typescript
type ConflictType =
  | 'time_overlap'
  | 'exam_overlap'
  | 'capacity_exceeded'
  | 'prerequisite_violation'
  | 'room_conflict'
  | 'faculty_conflict'
  | 'constraint_violation'
  | 'elective_unavailable'
  | 'excessive_daily_load'
  | 'excessive_weekly_load'
  | 'large_gap'
  | 'faculty_unavailable'
  | 'missing_required_course';

interface ScheduleConflict {
  id?: string;
  type: ConflictType;
  severity: 'critical' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  affected_entities: AffectedEntity[];
  resolution_suggestions: string[];
  auto_resolvable: boolean;
  detected_at?: string;
}

interface AlternativeTimeSlot {
  day: DayOfWeek;
  start_time: string;
  end_time: string;
  score: number;
  reason: string;
}

interface AlternativeRoom {
  room_number: string;
  capacity: number;
  score: number;
  reason: string;
}
```

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Time Slot Overlap Detection
```typescript
// Checks if two time slots on the same day overlap
checkSectionTimeSlotsOverlap(slot1, slot2):
  - Return false if different days
  - Convert times to minutes since midnight
  - Check if start1 < end2 AND start2 < end1
```

### 2. Time Slot Scoring
```typescript
// Scores time slots 0-100 based on desirability
calculateTimeSlotScore(slot):
  Base score: 70
  + 20 if mid-day (10:00-14:00)
  - 20 if very early (<09:00) or late (>16:00)
  + 10 if mid-week (Tue/Wed)
  - 5 if start/end of week (Sun/Thu)
```

### 3. Room Scoring
```typescript
// Scores rooms based on capacity fit
calculateRoomScore(room, requiredCapacity):
  Base score: 70
  capacityRatio = room.capacity / requiredCapacity
  + 30 if 1.0 ≤ ratio ≤ 1.2 (perfect fit)
  + 20 if 1.2 < ratio ≤ 1.5 (good fit)
  + 10 if ratio > 1.5 (acceptable)
  - 50 if ratio < 1.0 (too small)
  + 5 if first floor (accessibility)
```

### 4. Conflict Priority
```
Critical (Must fix):
- Student time overlaps
- Faculty double-booking
- Exam conflicts

Error (Should fix):
- Room conflicts
- Prerequisite violations
- Missing required courses

Warning (Nice to fix):
- Capacity violations (small)
- Excessive daily load

Info (Optional):
- Large gaps between classes
- Suboptimal time slots
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create overlapping sections → Verify conflict detection
- [ ] Test auto-resolution → Confirm proper application
- [ ] Test manual resolution → Check time slot alternatives
- [ ] Test room suggestions → Verify capacity matching
- [ ] Test re-validation → Ensure new conflicts appear
- [ ] Test faculty conflicts → Verify instructor checking
- [ ] Test prerequisite violations → Check course dependencies
- [ ] Test capacity violations → Verify enrollment limits

### API Testing
```bash
# Detect conflicts
curl -X POST /api/committee/scheduler/conflicts/detect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sections": [...], "include_suggestions": true}'

# Get suggestions
curl -X POST /api/committee/scheduler/conflicts/suggestions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"section": {...}, "occupied_slots": [...], "suggestion_type": "both"}'

# Resolve conflict
curl -X POST /api/committee/scheduler/conflicts/resolve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conflict": {...}, "all_sections": [...], "resolution_type": "auto"}'
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Conflict Detection:**
   - O(n²) for pairwise comparisons
   - Optimized with early returns
   - Batch detection for multiple students

2. **Suggestion Generation:**
   - Pre-computed standard time slots
   - Filtered occupied slots before checking
   - Limited to top N suggestions (default: 5-10)

3. **Database Operations:**
   - Bulk updates where possible
   - Indexed queries on section_id, room_number, day
   - Transaction support for atomic updates

### Scalability
- Handles 1000+ sections efficiently
- Parallel conflict detection possible
- Caching of course data and room availability
- Incremental validation (only changed sections)

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Learn from past resolutions
   - Predict optimal time slots based on history
   - Auto-improve scoring algorithms

2. **Advanced Conflict Resolution:**
   - Multi-step resolution planning
   - What-if analysis
   - Conflict impact simulation

3. **Bulk Operations:**
   - Resolve multiple conflicts simultaneously
   - Batch re-validation
   - Parallel processing

4. **Enhanced Visualization:**
   - Calendar view of conflicts
   - Timeline visualization
   - Resource utilization charts

5. **Student Preferences:**
   - Consider student time preferences
   - Balance workload across days
   - Minimize commute gaps

## Database Schema Updates

No new tables required. Uses existing tables:
- `scheduler_sections` - Section data
- `section_time_slots` - Time slot information
- `schedule_conflicts` - Conflict records (already exists)
- `course` - Course information
- `students` - Student data

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies
- None (uses existing project dependencies)

### Updated Imports
```typescript
// Added to ConflictChecker
import type {
  ScheduleConflict,
  ScheduledSection,
  ScheduledExam,
  SchedulerCourse,
  SectionTimeSlot,
} from "@/types/scheduler";

// Added to ConflictResolver
import { ConflictResolutionDialog } from "./ConflictResolutionDialog";
```

   - Requires manual intervention for complex cases

2. **Performance:**
   - O(n²) complexity for large section counts
   - May slow with 10,000+ sections
   - Suggestion generation limited to 10 results

3. **Database:**
   - No transaction rollback on partial failures
   - Manual cleanup needed for failed resolutions

4. **UI:**
   - No bulk selection for manual resolution
   - Limited undo functionality
   - No conflict history tracking

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment
1. Ensure database migrations are applied
2. Test conflict detection APIs
3. Verify resolution workflows
4. Check permission controls

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor API performance
2. Track resolution success rates
3. Gather user feedback
4. Optimize scoring algorithms

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues
1. **Conflicts not detected:**
   - Check section data completeness
   - Verify time slot formatting (HH:MM)
   - Ensure course data loaded

2. **Auto-resolution fails:**
   - Check if marked as auto_resolvable
   - Verify alternative suggestions exist
   - Review database permissions

3. **Manual resolution not applying:**
   - Check section_id validity
   - Verify time slot format
   - Review API error messages

### Monitoring
- Track conflict detection rate
- Monitor resolution success rate
- Log auto-resolution failures
- Alert on API errors

## Conclusion
