# Faculty Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive faculty module that enables faculty members to participate in the academic scheduling process, manage their teaching assignments, and access student feedback. All features are tightly integrated with the academic term system and controlled by phase-based permissions.

## Implementation Date

October 25, 2025

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend API Endpoints

Created 5 new API endpoints in `/src/app/api/faculty/`:

#### `/api/faculty/status` (GET)
- Returns faculty member's current status and active term information
- Provides counts of assigned courses
- Indicates phase status (schedule published, feedback open, etc.)
- Returns faculty profile information

#### `/api/faculty/courses` (GET)
- Fetches all sections assigned to the faculty member
- Includes course details, enrollment counts, and section times
- Provides capacity and enrollment statistics
- Retrieves course metadata (credits, department, level)

#### `/api/faculty/schedule` (GET)
- Generates weekly teaching schedule
- Organizes schedule items by day of week
- Includes time slots, room assignments, and course information
- Returns both flat list and grouped-by-day views

#### `/api/faculty/feedback` (GET)
- **Phase-Controlled**: Only accessible after feedback period closes
- Returns aggregated, anonymized student feedback
- Provides per-course statistics and overall metrics
- Includes rating distribution and text comments (anonymized)
- Enforces privacy by blocking access during active feedback periods

#### `/api/faculty/events` (GET)
- Fetches academic events relevant to faculty
- Filters events by audience (faculty, all, or no specific audience)
- Shows deadlines, milestones, and important dates
- Sorted chronologically

### 2. Dashboard Components

Created reusable React components in `/src/components/faculty/dashboard/`:

#### `FacultyStatusCards`
- Displays 3 status cards: Assigned Courses, Schedule Status, Feedback Access
- Visual indicators (icons, colors) for different states
- Real-time status updates based on term phase

#### `MyCoursesCard`
- Summary of assigned courses with quick stats
- Shows enrollment numbers and capacity
- Displays first class time for each course

- Shows course names and time slots
- Visual calendar-style layout
- Link to full schedule view

#### `FacultyUpcomingEvents`
- Displays upcoming deadlines and events
- Filtered for faculty-relevant items
- Active event highlighting
- Countdown indicators

### 3. Faculty Dashboard Pages

Created comprehensive faculty portal with 4 main pages:

#### `/faculty/dashboard` (Main Dashboard)
**Components**:

### 4. Phase-Based Permission System

Created permission logic in `/src/lib/faculty-permissions.ts`:

#### Permission Helpers
- `canFacultyPerformAction()`: Check if an action is allowed in current phase
- `getCurrentFacultyPhase()`: Get current phase and allowed actions
- `canAccessFeedback()`: Specific helper for feedback access
- `canViewCourses()`: Specific helper for course access
- `canSubmitSuggestions()`: Specific helper for schedule suggestions

#### Supported Actions
- `view_courses`: Available after schedule publication
- `view_schedule`: Available after schedule publication
- `view_feedback`: Available ONLY after feedback period closes
- `submit_suggestions`: Available during scheduling phase
- `view_students`: Available after schedule publication

#### Academic Phases
1. **Scheduling Phase**: Schedule being prepared
2. **Registration Phase**: Students registering
3. **Active Term Phase**: Classes in session
4. **Post-Feedback Phase**: Feedback available for review

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in `/src/docs/features/faculty-features.md`:

**Contents**:
- Architecture overview
- Database schema reference
- Feature descriptions with routes and API endpoints
- Phase-based permission system explained
- API reference with TypeScript types
- Component documentation
- User workflow walkthrough
- Security and privacy considerations
- Future enhancement plans
- Testing guidelines

## Technical Details

- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

### Database Tables Used

- `section_time`: Class time slots
- `course`: Course catalog
- `academic_term`: Active term and phase flags
- `term_events`: Academic calendar events

## Security & Privacy

### Feedback Anonymization
- Feedback only accessible after period closes
- No student identifiers in responses
- Aggregate-only data for small sample sizes
- Privacy-first architecture

### Row Level Security
- All queries respect Supabase RLS policies
- Faculty can only view their own data
- Committee members have broader access
- Authentication required for all endpoints

### Phase-Based Restrictions
- API endpoints validate term phase
- UI components hide unavailable features
- Clear messaging about locked features
- Automatic updates when phases change

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Student Dashboard**: Mirrors UI patterns and structure
- **Academic Term System**: Uses same `academic_term` table and flags
- **Term Events**: Filters events for faculty audience
- **Timeline Helpers**: Reuses event formatting and styling
- **Authentication**: Uses existing auth flow and role checks

### Color System
- Follows unified color system
- Status colors (green, amber, blue) for different states
- Dark mode support
- Consistent with student and committee interfaces

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Test Faculty Account**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (id, email, full_name, role)
   VALUES ('test-faculty-id', 'faculty@test.edu', 'Dr. Test Faculty', 'faculty');
   
   INSERT INTO faculty (id, faculty_number, title, status)
   VALUES ('test-faculty-id', 'FAC001', 'Professor', 'active');
   ```

2. **Assign Test Sections**
   ```sql
   UPDATE section
   SET instructor_id = 'test-faculty-id'
   WHERE id = 'SECTION-ID';
   ```

3. **Test Phase Transitions**
   - Toggle `schedule_published` in `academic_term`
   - Toggle `feedback_open` in `academic_term`
   - Verify UI updates and access control

4. **Test Feedback Access**
   - Try accessing feedback while `feedback_open = true` (should be blocked)
   - Close feedback period and verify access granted
   - Check anonymization of feedback data

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
1. **Schedule Suggestions System**
   - Allow faculty to propose time changes
   - Committee review and approval workflow
   - Conflict detection

2. **Availability Management**
   - Set preferred teaching times
   - Block unavailable slots
   - Recurring commitments

### Long-term
3. **Student Lists & Rosters**
   - View enrolled students per section
   - Export class rosters
   - Track attendance (optional)

4. **Course Materials Integration**
   - Upload syllabus
   - Share resources
   - Integration with LMS

5. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Historical feedback trends
   - Teaching load analysis
   - Student success metrics

## Migration Notes

No database migrations required! The implementation uses existing tables:
- `faculty` (already exists)
- `section` (already exists with `instructor_id`)
- `academic_term` (already exists)
- `term_events` (already exists)
- `feedback` (already exists)

## Success Metrics

✅ **Complete faculty experience created**
✅ **Phase-based permissions implemented**
✅ **Anonymized feedback system working**
✅ **Responsive UI following design system**
✅ **Type-safe API endpoints**
✅ **Comprehensive documentation**
✅ **Zero linter errors**

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real faculty accounts**
2. **Gather feedback on UI/UX**
3. **Implement schedule suggestions system**
4. **Add availability management**
5. **Expand feedback analytics**
