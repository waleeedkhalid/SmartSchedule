# Faculty Availability Management Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive faculty availability management system that allows faculty members to submit and manage their preferred teaching time slots. The system integrates with the existing academic term phases and enforces permission-based access control.

## Implementation Date

October 25, 2025

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema

Created migration: `supabase/migrations/20250125_faculty_availability.sql`

**New Table**: `faculty_availability`
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `faculty_id` (UUID, references users.id)
- `term_code` (TEXT, references academic_term.code)
- `availability_data` (JSONB) - stores time slot selections as key-value pairs
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- Unique constraint on `(faculty_id, term_code)` - one submission per faculty per term

**RLS Policies**:
- Faculty can CRUD their own availability records
- Committee members can view all availability submissions
- Proper authentication checks on all operations

**Indexes**:
- `idx_faculty_availability_faculty` - fast lookup by faculty
- `idx_faculty_availability_term` - fast lookup by term
- `idx_faculty_availability_data` (GIN) - JSONB queries
- `idx_faculty_availability_created` - sorted by creation time

### 2. Backend API

Created: `src/app/api/faculty/availability/route.ts`

#### GET Endpoint
- Fetches availability for the current active term
- Returns availability data and last updated timestamp
- Returns null if no submission exists
- Validates faculty authentication

#### POST Endpoint
- Saves/updates availability for the current active term
- Uses upsert to handle both create and update cases
- Validates term phase using `canSubmitSuggestions()` permission helper
- Returns error if schedule is already published (locked phase)
- Full authentication and authorization checks

**Response Format**:
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  data: {
    availability_data: Record<string, boolean>;
    lastUpdated: string;
    termCode: string;
  } | null;
  error?: string;
}
```

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Updated: `FacultyAvailabilityForm.tsx`

**New Features**:
- Automatic data fetching on mount
- Real-time save to backend API
- Loading states with spinner
- Error handling with alert messages
- Phase-based locking (disabled when schedule published)
- "Last saved" timestamp display
- Success feedback with auto-hide
- Props for `canSubmit` and `lockReason` to control access

**Key Changes**:
- Added `useEffect` hook for data fetching
- Replaced mock save with actual API call
- Added loading skeleton during initial fetch
- Added error state management
- Disabled all interactions when `canSubmit=false`
- Enhanced visual feedback for locked state

#### Created: `FacultyAvailabilityClient.tsx`

**Features**:
- Wraps the availability form with context
- Displays active term information
- Shows permission status alerts
- Phase-aware messaging (open/closed)
- Help text explaining how availability works
- Navigation back to dashboard
- Clean, professional UI layout

#### Created: `AvailabilityStatusCard.tsx`

**Dashboard Widget**:
- Shows submission status (Submitted/Pending)
- Displays total available slots selected
- Shows last updated date
- Quick action buttons (Submit/Update)
- Automatic data fetching
- Visual badges for status indication
- Integrated into faculty dashboard

### 4. Page Route

Created: `src/app/faculty/availability/page.tsx`

**Features**:
- Server component with authentication check
- Role verification (faculty only)
- Fetches active term for permission checking
- Redirects non-authenticated users
- Passes term data to client component

### 5. Dashboard Integration

Modified: `src/app/faculty/dashboard/FacultyDashboardClient.tsx`

**Updates**:
- Added `AvailabilityStatusCard` to main content grid
- Reorganized layout for better visual balance
- New card appears next to "My Courses"
- Maintains consistent design language

Modified: `src/components/faculty/dashboard/index.ts`

**Updates**:
- Exported new `AvailabilityStatusCard` component
- Maintains consistent export pattern

### 6. Type Definitions

Modified: `src/types/index.ts`

**Added**:
```typescript
export interface FacultyAvailabilityData {
  id: string;
  faculty_id: string;
  term_code: string;
  availability_data: Record<string, boolean>;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### 7. Documentation

## Technical Details

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

### Database Design
- JSONB storage for flexible slot structure
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate submissions
- GIN index for efficient JSONB queries
- Foreign keys ensure referential integrity
- Cascade deletes maintain data consistency

### Permission Integration
Uses existing `faculty-permissions.ts` helpers:
- `canSubmitSuggestions(term)` - checks if schedule is published
- Returns `{ allowed: boolean, reason?: string }`
- Enforced at both API and UI levels
- Consistent permission logic across the app

## Data Structure

### Availability Data Format
```typescript
{
  "Sunday-08:00 [8AM]": true,
  "Sunday-09:00 [9AM]": false,
  "Monday-10:00 [10AM]": true,
  // ... more slots
}
```

- Keys: `"${Day}-${Hour}"` format
- Values: `boolean` (true = available, false = unavailable)
- Stored as JSONB in PostgreSQL
- Flexible structure allows easy querying and updates

## Testing Guide

### 1. Create Faculty Test Account
```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email, full_name, role)
VALUES ('test-faculty-id', 'faculty@test.edu', 'Dr. Test Faculty', 'faculty');

INSERT INTO faculty (id, faculty_number, title, status)
VALUES ('test-faculty-id', 'FAC001', 'Professor', 'active');
```

### 2. Test During Scheduling Phase
```sql
-- Ensure schedule is NOT published
UPDATE academic_term
SET schedule_published = false
WHERE is_active = true;
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Can access `/faculty/availability`
- ✅ Can toggle time slots
- ✅ Can save availability
- ✅ Dashboard shows "Pending" or "Submitted" status

### 3. Test After Schedule Publication
```sql
-- Publish schedule
UPDATE academic_term
SET schedule_published = true
WHERE is_active = true;
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Can view saved availability (read-only)
- ❌ Cannot modify slots (disabled)
- ❌ Save button disabled
- ✅ Lock message displayed
- ✅ API returns 403 error on POST attempt

### 4. Test Data Persistence
1. Submit availability with 20 slots selected
2. Refresh page
3. Verify all 20 slots are still selected
4. Check last updated timestamp

### 5. Test Committee Access
```sql
-- Create committee member
INSERT INTO users (id, email, full_name, role)
VALUES ('committee-id', 'committee@test.edu', 'Committee Member', 'scheduling_committee');
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Committee can view all faculty availability
- ✅ Committee can query `faculty_availability` table

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Academic Term System**: Uses `academic_term` table for phase checking
- **Faculty Permissions**: Uses existing `canSubmitSuggestions()` helper
- **Faculty Dashboard**: Integrates with existing dashboard layout
- **Authentication**: Uses existing Supabase auth flow

### API Conventions
- Follows existing faculty API pattern (`/api/faculty/*`)
- Consistent response format with other endpoints
- Standard error handling approach
- Same authentication mechanism

## Success Metrics

✅ **Database migration created and documented**
✅ **API endpoints fully functional (GET/POST)**
✅ **Frontend component connected to backend**
✅ **Phase-based permissions enforced**
✅ **Dashboard integration complete**
✅ **Type definitions added**
✅ **Documentation updated**
✅ **Zero linter errors**
✅ **Responsive UI with dark mode support**
✅ **Real-time data persistence**

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
1. **Committee Dashboard View**
   - View all faculty availability in grid format
   - Filter by department or faculty
   - Export to CSV for scheduling software

2. **Conflict Detection**
   - Highlight times with low faculty availability
   - Suggest alternative time slots
   - Optimize based on preferences

### Long-term
3. **Recurring Availability**
   - Save as template for future terms
   - Copy from previous term
   - Semester-specific patterns

4. **Availability Analytics**
   - Show popularity of time slots
   - Department-wide availability heatmap
   - Optimize scheduling based on data

## Migration Notes
