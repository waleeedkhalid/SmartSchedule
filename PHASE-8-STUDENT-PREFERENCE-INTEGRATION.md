## API Integration

### Endpoint Used
`GET /api/committee/scheduler/student-counts`

Query Parameters:
- `term_code`: string (required) - Academic term identifier
- `group_by`: 'course' | 'level' | 'course_type' (optional, default: 'course')

### Response Format

#### By Course (group_by=course)
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    term_code: string,
    courses: StudentEnrollmentData[],
    total_courses: number
  }
}
```

#### By Level (group_by=level)
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    term_code: string,
    by_level: LevelEnrollmentSummary[]
  }
}
```

#### By Course Type (group_by=course_type)
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    term_code: string,
    by_course_type: CourseTypeEnrollmentSummary[]
  }
}
```

## Type Definitions

All types are defined in `src/types/scheduler.ts`:

### StudentEnrollmentData
```typescript
interface StudentEnrollmentData {
  course_code: string;
  course_name: string;
  course_type: 'REQUIRED' | 'ELECTIVE';
  level: number | null;
  total_students: number;
  enrolled_students: number;
  preference_counts: ElectivePreferenceCount[];
  sections_needed: number;
}
```

### LevelEnrollmentSummary
```typescript
interface LevelEnrollmentSummary {
  level: number;
  student_count: number;
  required_courses: number;
  elective_selections: number;
}
```

### CourseTypeEnrollmentSummary
```typescript
interface CourseTypeEnrollmentSummary {
  type: 'REQUIRED' | 'ELECTIVE';
  course_count: number;
  total_enrollments: number;
  avg_students_per_course: number;
}
```

## User Interface Features

### Navigation
Access via: Committee Dashboard â†’ Scheduler â†’ Student Counts

### Tab Structure
1. **By Course**: Detailed course-level enrollment data
2. **By Level**: Student distribution across academic levels
3. **By Type**: Required vs Elective course analysis

### Key UI Elements
- **Search Bar**: Real-time filtering across course codes and names
- **Filter Dropdowns**: Level, Type, and Capacity filters
- **Statistics Cards**: At-a-glance metrics
- **Data Tables**: Sortable, filterable enrollment data
- **Visual Charts**: Progress bars and distribution visualizations
- **Export Button**: CSV download functionality

## Business Logic

### Section Capacity Calculation
```typescript
sections_needed = Math.ceil(total_students / standard_section_capacity)
```

Standard section capacity is typically 30-40 students depending on course type.

### Utilization Calculation
```typescript
utilization = (enrolled_students / total_students) * 100
```

### Capacity Status Rules
- **Critical** (Over): utilization > 100%
- **Warning** (High): 90% < utilization â‰¤ 100%
- **Normal** (OK): 50% < utilization â‰¤ 90%
- **Low** (Under): utilization â‰¤ 50%

## Features for Different User Roles

### Scheduling Committee
- View all enrollment data across all levels
- Export data for reporting
- Plan section capacities based on student counts
- Track elective preferences to optimize offerings
- Identify capacity issues before they become critical

### Academic Advisors (Future Enhancement)
- View level-specific data for advising
- Track student distribution for workload planning

## Integration Points

### Database Tables Used
1. `enrollment` - Student course enrollments
2. `students` - Student level information
3. `course` - Course details and type
4. `elective_preferences` - Student elective preferences
5. `academic_term` - Term information

### Database Functions Used
- `get_course_enrollment_stats(p_term_code)` - Retrieves enrollment statistics

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- Parallel API calls for different views
- Cached results within component session
- Efficient filtering using useMemo hooks

### Optimization Strategies
- Client-side filtering after initial load
- Lazy loading of tab content
- Memoized calculations for statistics
- Debounced search input (implicit via React state)

## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers
```bash
# Navigate to student counts page
/committee/scheduler/student-counts

# Components location
src/components/committee/scheduler/student-counts/

# API endpoint
GET /api/committee/scheduler/student-counts?term_code=2024-1&group_by=course
```

### For Users
1. Log in as committee member
2. Navigate to Committee Dashboard
3. Select "Scheduler" from menu
4. Click "Student Counts" or navigate to `/committee/scheduler/student-counts`
5. Use tabs to switch between views
6. Apply filters as needed
7. Export data if required

## Known Limitations

1. **Capacity Adjustment**: Currently read-only; capacity adjustments require manual database updates
2. **Historical Data**: No term-over-term comparison yet
3. **Real-time Updates**: Data refresh requires page reload
4. **Irregular Students**: Tracking not yet implemented (Phase 8.2)
5. **Custom Reporting**: No custom report builder yet

## Conclusion

Phase 8 successfully implements comprehensive student enrollment tracking and capacity management. The system provides committee members with detailed insights needed for effective schedule planning, while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface that follows established patterns from previous phases.

The implementation is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements including capacity adjustments and irregular student tracking.
