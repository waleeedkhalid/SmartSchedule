# Scheduler Dashboard Rebuild - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Scheduler Dashboard has been completely rebuilt to integrate with the comprehensive scheduling system implementation. The dashboard now displays real-time data from all scheduling features and provides actionable insights to the scheduling committee.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Critical Bug**
- ✅ **FIXED**: Changed table name from `"user"` to `"users"` (line 73 in original)
- This was causing database query failures

### 2. **Enhanced Data Fetching**
The dashboard now fetches comprehensive real-time data from multiple tables:

```typescript
// Data sources integrated:
- academic_term (active term detection)
- course (SWE-managed courses)
- students (total student count)
- section (sections by term, status tracking)
- section_enrollment (enrollment statistics)
- schedule_conflicts (unresolved conflicts with severity)
- elective_preferences (submission tracking)
- term_events (upcoming academic events)
```

### 3. **New Dashboard Statistics**

#### **Four Primary Stat Cards**
1. **Total Courses**
   - Shows count of SWE-managed courses
   - Label: "SWE-managed courses"

2. **Total Students**
   - Shows total active students
   - Label: "Active students"

3. **Generated Sections**
   - Shows total sections for active term
   - Displays last generation timestamp (e.g., "Last: 3 days ago")
   - Shows publication progress bar (Published sections / Total sections)
   - Status changes from "Not generated yet" to actual data

4. **Active Conflicts**
   - Shows unresolved conflict count
   - Color-coded indicator (red for conflicts, green for none)
   - Severity breakdown badges (Critical, Error, Warning)
   - Dynamic icon (AlertCircle for conflicts, CheckCircle2 for no conflicts)

### 4. **Upcoming Events Widget**
A new widget displaying the next 5 academic events from `term_events` table:

**Features:**
- Event title and date
- Days until event (color-coded urgency indicator)
  - Red dot: ≤ 3 days
  - Orange dot: 4-7 days
  - Blue dot: > 7 days
- Event category badge
- Formatted date display
- Empty state with icon when no events

### 5. **System Overview Widget**
A comprehensive overview showing key system metrics:

**Three Sections:**

1. **Total Enrollments**
   - Count of students enrolled in sections
   - Blue-themed card
   - Shows active enrollments for current term

2. **Elective Preferences**
   - Total submitted preferences
   - Purple-themed card
   - Submission rate percentage
   - Progress bar showing submission rate

3. **Schedule Status Summary**
   - Current status badge (Published / Draft / Not Generated)
   - Total sections count
   - Conflicts count (color-coded)

### 6. **Enhanced Schedule Status Detection**

```typescript
// Schedule Status Logic:
- "not_generated": No sections exist for active term
- "draft": Sections exist but none are published
- "published": At least one section is published
```

### 7. **Conflict Severity Breakdown**
Conflicts are now categorized and counted by severity:
- **Critical**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
- **Error**: Significant problems that must be resolved
- **Warning**: Issues that should be addressed
- **Info**: Informational notices

### 8. **Improved Notice System**

**Two Dynamic Notices:**

1. **Schedule Generation Required** (Blue)
   - Shows when no schedule exists
   - Direct link to schedule generation page

2. **Scheduling Conflicts Detected** (Red)
   - Shows when unresolved conflicts exist
   - Displays conflict count and severity
   - Quick access button to view conflicts
   - Critical conflict badge if present

### 9. **UI/UX Improvements**

**Layout Changes:**
- Changed from 3-column to 4-column grid for stat cards
- Responsive design (1 col on mobile, 2 on tablet, 4 on desktop)
- Added two-column widget section before main actions
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with color-coded indicators
- Improved spacing and card organization

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Progress bars for tracking completion
- Color-coded status indicators
- Severity-based badges
- Icons for better visual communication
- Hover effects on cards
- Dark mode support maintained

### 10. **Performance Optimizations**
- Parallel data fetching using `Promise.all()`
- Single effect hook for all data loading
- Optimized query patterns (count-only where appropriate)
- Efficient state management

## Data Flow

```
Component Mount
    ↓
Fetch User Data
    ↓
Get Active Term Code
    ↓
Parallel Fetch (9 queries):
    - Courses count
    - Students count
    - Sections with timestamps
    - Published sections count
    - Enrollments count
    - Conflicts with severity
    - Elective preferences
    - Student count for rate calc

## New Interfaces

```typescript
interface DashboardStats {
  totalCourses: number;
  totalStudents: number;
  totalSections: number;
  publishedSections: number;
  totalEnrollments: number;
  unresolvedConflicts: number;
  conflictsBySeverity: {
    critical: number;
    error: number;
    warning: number;
    info: number;
  };
  scheduleStatus: "not_generated" | "draft" | "published";
  lastGeneratedAt: string | null;
  preferenceSubmissionRate: number;
  totalPreferences: number;
}

interface UpcomingEvent {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  event_type: string;
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string;
  category: string;
}
```

## Database Tables Utilized

| Table | Purpose | Data Retrieved |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `users` | User profile | Name, email, role |
| `academic_term` | Term info | Active term code |
| `course` | Course catalog | SWE-managed course count |
| `students` | Student records | Total student count |
| `section` | Course sections | Section count, status, timestamps |
| `section_enrollment` | Enrollments | Total enrollment count |
| `schedule_conflicts` | Conflicts | Unresolved conflicts by severity |
| `elective_preferences` | Student preferences | Submitted preferences count |
| `term_events` | Academic events | Upcoming events (next 5) |

## Impact on User Experience

### Before
- Static data (hardcoded "scheduleGenerated: false")
- No conflict visibility
- No enrollment tracking
- No event timeline
- Limited actionable insights
- 3 basic stat cards

### After
- Real-time data from database
- Full conflict tracking with severity
- Comprehensive enrollment statistics
- Upcoming events visibility
- Multiple actionable insights
- 4 enhanced stat cards + 2 widget sections
- Dynamic notices based on system state
- Progress tracking for section publication

## Testing Recommendations
