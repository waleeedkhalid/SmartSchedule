## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### Component Hierarchy
```
CourseManagementPage (Server)
└── CourseManagementClient (Client)
    ├── CourseList
    │   ├── SectionManager (Dialog)
    │   └── CourseForm (Dialog)
    └── ExternalCourseViewer
```

### Data Flow
1. **Server Component** authenticates and provides initial data
2. **Client Component** manages state and API calls
3. **Child Components** handle specific features and user interactions
4. **API Integration** through existing scheduler API endpoints

### State Management
- Local component state with useState
- React hooks for side effects
- Prop drilling for shared state
- Callback functions for updates
- No external state management needed

### API Integration
Uses existing Phase 2 API endpoints:
- `GET /api/committee/scheduler/courses` - Fetch courses with sections
- `POST /api/committee/scheduler/courses` - Create new section
- `PATCH /api/committee/scheduler/courses` - Update section
- `DELETE /api/committee/scheduler/courses` - Delete section
