## BLOCKERS (by owner)

Types/Schema

- Duplicate ExamRecord definitions

  - Evidence: `src/lib/committee-data-helpers.ts` (type ExamRecord) vs `src/components/committee/scheduler/ExamTableViewOnly.tsx` (interface ExamRecord with ExamType)
  - Impact: UI and helper layers diverge on exam type shape; risk of runtime mismatch.
  - Suggested Target Owner: Types/Schema

- Local Course alias vs canonical CourseOffering

  - Evidence: `src/components/committee/scheduler/courses-editor/CoursesEditor.tsx` defines local `Course`, `CourseSection`, `CourseTime` vs canonical `CourseOffering`/`Section` in `src/lib/types.ts`.
  - Impact: Divergent shapes; increases maintenance and mapping bugs.
  - Suggested Target Owner: Types/Schema

- SWEStudent vs DB students table mismatch

  - Evidence: TS `SWEStudent` (`src/lib/types.ts`) vs SQL `students` (`supabase-schema.sql` includes email, major, gpa, completed_credits, totals).
  - Impact: API/profile mapping inconsistencies; potential loss of data fields.
  - Suggested Target Owner: Types/Schema, DB/SQL

- ElectivePreference vs DB elective_preferences drift

  - Evidence: TS `ElectivePreference { id, studentId, courseCode, priority }` vs SQL `elective_preferences { id, submission_id, student_id, course_code, priority, package_id }`.
  - Impact: API payloads don’t include `package_id`/`submission_id`; storage/queries diverge.
  - Suggested Target Owner: Types/Schema, API

- Missing DB sources for courses/sections
  - Evidence: API `GET /api/courses` expects `course_offerings` table; `GET /api/sections` expects `sections_view`. Not present in `supabase-schema.sql`.
  - Impact: API returns mock-only; production persistence blocked.
  - Suggested Target Owner: DB/SQL

API

- Non-existent endpoints referenced by UI

  - Evidence: `src/components/committee/scheduler/GenerateScheduleDialog.tsx` fetches `/api/schedule/generate` (no route file). Also commented `/api/committee/schedule/generate` in `GenerateButton.tsx`.
  - Impact: Broken actions; feature blocked.
  - Suggested Target Owner: API

- Mock auth endpoint in production tree
  - Evidence: `src/app/api/auth/student/route.ts` authenticates against in-file `MOCK_STUDENTS`.
  - Impact: Security and environment drift; should be Supabase.
  - Suggested Target Owner: API, DB/SQL

Frontend Data Flow

- Heavy inline transforms in components
  - Evidence: numerous map/filter/reduce/sort across student electives and committee scheduler UIs (see section “Overlapping/Inline Logic”).
  - Impact: Non-reusable logic; hard to test; type drift.
  - Suggested Target Owner: Frontend Data Flow

Mock Data

- Scattered mock sources with domain shapes
  - Evidence: `src/data/mockData.ts` (large catalog), `mockSWE*`, `external-departments.json`.
  - Impact: Drift from canonical types and DB; ambiguous runtime source.
  - Suggested Target Owner: Mock Data

DB/SQL

- Schema coverage limited to student/elective flows
  - Evidence: `supabase-schema.sql` lacks course/section/timetable tables and views referenced by API layer.
  - Impact: Incomplete persistence; API falls back to mocks.
  - Suggested Target Owner: DB/SQL

Build/Tooling

- Architecture stack mismatch note
  - Evidence: Repo dependencies don’t include Zustand though mentioned in high-level stack (context). Local state appears custom (`src/lib/local-state.ts`).
  - Impact: Expectations vs implementation drift; not blocking build, but relevant for alignment.
  - Suggested Target Owner: Build/Tooling

## Conflicting Types (expanded)

Entity | Definitions[paths] | KeyDiffs

- Course (view model) | `src/components/committee/scheduler/courses-editor/CoursesEditor.tsx` (local `Course`) vs canonical `CourseOffering` (`src/lib/types.ts`) | Local has `exams` nested and `sections[].times{day,start,end}`; canonical uses `CourseOffering` with `sections: Section[]` and may have `meetings?: SectionMeeting[]` as normalized option.
- Section | `src/lib/types.ts` only | One definition, but carries both legacy `times` (string-based) and optional `meetings` (numeric normalized). Risk of dual-mode drift.
- ExamRecord | `src/lib/committee-data-helpers.ts` vs `src/components/committee/scheduler/ExamTableViewOnly.tsx` | Helper uses `type: "midterm"|"midterm2"|"final"`; component uses `ExamType` alias — likely diverging union.
- SWEStudent | `src/lib/types.ts` vs DB `students` | TS lacks several DB fields (email, major, gpa, credits). Different identifiers (`id` vs `user_id`/`student_id`).
- ElectivePreference | `src/lib/types.ts` vs DB `elective_preferences` | TS missing `package_id` and `submission_id` linkage.
- Schedule/GeneratedSchedule | `src/lib/types.ts` (two distinct shapes) | Separate intents (student vs committee). Needs clear naming and mapping to DB JSON (`student_schedules.schedule_data`).

## Overlapping/Inline Logic (expanded)

ComponentPath | InlineTransforms[] | SuggestedHelperModule

- `src/components/student/electives/SubmissionSuccess.tsx` | reduce total credits; group by package; sort by priority | `@/lib/student-schedule-helpers` or new `@/lib/student-electives-helpers`
- `src/components/student/electives/SelectionPanel.tsx` | reduce totals; sort and map priorities | `@/lib/student-electives-helpers`
- `src/components/student/electives/ReviewSubmitDialog.tsx` | reduce totals; group by package; sort by priority | `@/lib/student-electives-helpers`
- `src/components/student/electives/ElectiveBrowser.tsx` | flatMap packages; multi-stage filter; recompute priorities; reduce credits per package | `@/lib/student-electives-helpers`
- `src/components/committee/scheduler/SchedulePreviewer.tsx` | flatten courses/sections; unique by code via Map; grid aggregation by day/time | `@/lib/committee-data-helpers`
- `src/components/committee/scheduler/CourseEditor.tsx` | unique levels; filtering by level; reduce credits | `@/lib/committee-data-helpers`
- `src/components/committee/scheduler/student-counts/StudentCountsTable.tsx` | map rows; aggregate totals; sort distributions | `@/lib/committee-data-helpers`
- `src/components/committee/registrar/RegistrarCapacityManager.tsx` | filter SWE courses; map reductions; total added seats | `@/lib/committee-data-helpers`
- `src/components/committee/scheduler/SectionEnrollmentManager.tsx` | filters; reduce enrolled counts; grouping by course | `@/lib/committee-data-helpers`
- `src/components/student/ExamScheduleTable.tsx` | flatMap over weeks/days; compute slot counts | `@/lib/student-schedule-helpers`

## API Route Inventory

Method | Path | Params | Request Body (shape) | Response (shape) | Known Consumers | Notes

- GET | /api/courses | — | — | `{ data: CourseOffering[], meta }` | UI consumers via SWR/fetch (not explicitly found) | Falls back to in-memory `courseOfferingService`; Supabase table `course_offerings` assumed but not in schema
- GET | /api/sections | — | — | `{ data: Section[], meta }` | UI components summarizing sections | Supabase `sections_view` assumed but not in schema
- POST | /api/electives/submit | — | `ElectiveSubmissionPayload { studentId: string; selections: { packageId; courseCode; priority }[] }` | `ElectiveSubmissionResponse { success, submissionId, timestamp, message?, error? }` | `src/app/student/electives/page.tsx`, `src/app/demo/student/electives/page.tsx` | Uses `supabaseAdmin`; requires `students`, `elective_submissions`, `elective_preferences`, and view `student_submission_details`
- GET | /api/electives/submit | `?studentId` | — | `{ success: true, submissions: any[] }` | same pages (history retrieval) | Reads `student_submission_details` view
- POST | /api/auth/student | — | `StudentAuthRequest { studentId, password }` | `StudentAuthResponse { success, session? }` | `src/app/demo/student/electives/page.tsx` | Mock-only authentication; planned Supabase replacement
- GET | /api/student/profile | `?userId` | — | `{ success, student }` | likely `src/app/student/profile/page.tsx` | Uses `getStudentByEmail`/`getStudentProfile`; view `student_profiles` present in schema

API Contract Drift

- UI calls nonexistent endpoint: `/api/schedule/generate` (in `GenerateScheduleDialog.tsx`). No corresponding `route.ts`. Build output confirms only 5 API routes.
- `/api/courses` and `/api/sections` reference Supabase tables/views (`course_offerings`, `sections_view`) missing in `supabase-schema.sql`.

## Mock Data Inventory

MockFile | Consumer(s) | ShapeSummary | DriftFromTargetSchema?

- `src/data/mockData.ts` | Committee scheduler UIs, registrar tools (indirectly via helpers); possibly `courseOfferingService` seed | Course catalog with `code,name,credits,department,level,type,prerequisites,exams{midterm,midterm2,final}, sections[{id,courseCode,instructor,room,times[]}]` | DB lacks course/section tables; time model uses string-based `times` vs normalized `SectionMeeting` in TS; exam fields not mapped to SQL
- `src/data/external-departments.json` | `CoursesEditor.tsx` | List of departments/courses external to SWE | No direct DB mapping; UI-only
- `src/data/mockRooms.ts` | Committee UIs | Rooms list | No SQL mapping present
- `src/data/mockSWEStudents.ts` | Committee UIs (irregular students, registrar) | SWE student samples | Diverges from SQL `students` table shape
- `src/data/mockSWEFaculty.ts` | Teaching load UIs | Faculty list with availability/load | No SQL mapping present
- `src/data/mockSWECurriculum.ts` | Student/committee | Curriculum levels and requirements | Not represented in SQL

Recommendation (Phase 4): retain mocks for tests only after DB parity; deprecate others.

## Supabase Schema Map

Tables | Columns (type) | Constraints/Indexes | Notes

- students | id UUID PK; user_id UUID UNIQUE; student_id TEXT UNIQUE; name TEXT; email TEXT UNIQUE; level INT; major TEXT; gpa DECIMAL(3,2); completed_credits INT; total_credits INT; timestamps | RLS enabled; indexes on user_id, student_id, email; updated_at trigger | Source for Student Profile API
- completed_courses | id UUID PK; student_id UUID FK->students.id; course_code TEXT; grade TEXT; semester TEXT; year INT; created_at | UNIQUE(student_id, course_code); indexes | No TS type present — add in Phase 2
- elective_submissions | id UUID PK; student_id UUID FK; submission_id TEXT UNIQUE; submitted_at; status; timestamps | RLS enabled; indexes on student_id, status, submission_id | Used by electives submit API
- elective_preferences | id UUID PK; submission_id UUID FK; student_id UUID FK; course_code TEXT; priority INT; package_id TEXT; created_at | UNIQUE(submission_id, course_code); indexes | TS type missing `package_id` and linkage fields
- student_schedules | id UUID PK; student_id UUID FK; semester TEXT; schedule_data JSONB; generated_at; timestamps | UNIQUE(student_id, semester); RLS enabled | Maps to student-side `Schedule` JSON
- student_feedback | id UUID PK; student_id UUID FK; feedback_text TEXT; category TEXT; submitted_at; created_at | RLS enabled; index on student_id | TS feedback type not found

Views

- student_profiles | Aggregates students + completed_courses (array completed_courses)
- student_submission_details | Aggregates submissions + preferences (ordered)

Source of Truth candidates

Entity | TS Type (path) | DB Table | Notes | Proposed Source-of-Truth

- Student | SWEStudent (`src/lib/types.ts`) | students | Mismatch in fields and identifiers | DB
- CompletedCourse | — | completed_courses | Missing TS type | DB
- ElectivePreference | ElectivePreference (`src/lib/types.ts`) | elective_preferences | TS missing `package_id`, `submission_id` | DB
- ElectiveSubmission | — | elective_submissions | Not modeled in TS | DB
- StudentSchedule | Schedule (`src/lib/types.ts`) | student_schedules.schedule_data (JSONB) | TS/DB need JSON shape agreement | TS + DB JSON
- CourseOffering | CourseOffering (`src/lib/types.ts`) | — (missing) | API expects `course_offerings` | TS (now) → DB (planned)
- Section | Section (`src/lib/types.ts`) | — / sections_view (missing) | Legacy `times` vs normalized `meetings` | TS (now) → DB (planned)
- ExamRecord | type in helpers; interface in component | — | UI/helper duplication | TS (consolidate in helpers)

## Merging Targets (Phase 2 plan)

Entity | Canonical TS Type (path) | Canonical DB Table | Non-canonical aliases to replace (paths)

- CourseOffering | `src/lib/types.ts#CourseOffering` | course_offerings (to add) | `CoursesEditor.tsx` local `Course`
- Section | `src/lib/types.ts#Section` | sections (+ view) | `CoursesEditor.tsx` local `CourseSection`/`CourseTime`
- ExamRecord | `src/lib/committee-data-helpers.ts#ExamRecord` | — | `components/committee/scheduler/ExamTableViewOnly.tsx#ExamRecord`
- SWEStudent | `src/lib/types.ts#SWEStudent` | students | usages expecting minimal fields in UI
- ElectivePreference | `src/lib/types.ts#ElectivePreference` | elective_preferences | adjust to include `package_id`/submission link in API adapters
- Schedule (student) | `src/lib/types.ts#Schedule` | student_schedules.schedule_data | any ad-hoc schedule objects in components

## Build/Runtime Warnings (read-only)

- Build command: `next build --turbopack` — Completed successfully with 0 warnings/errors.
- Notable console output during build (from app code):
  - "Current draft state" logs from committee scheduler drafts printed to console (non-blocking, but noisy).
- Routes generated (from build): 5 API routes; 27+ static pages.

## Clarifications Needed

- (a, c) Are `CourseOffering` and `Section` intended to be fully persisted in Supabase this phase, or remain mock-only until Phase 3? Files implying DB use: `src/app/api/courses/route.ts`, `src/app/api/sections/route.ts`.
- (b, c) Should `ExamRecord` use a central union type ("midterm"|"midterm2"|"final") across UI and helpers? Conflict: `ExamTableViewOnly.tsx` vs `lib/committee-data-helpers.ts`.
- (c) For sections time model, is the target to deprecate legacy `times: {day,start,end}[]` in favor of numeric `SectionMeeting[]`? Mixed usage across helpers and student layer.
- (b, e) What is the authoritative identifier for students in APIs: `userId` (UUID), `studentId` (human-readable), or email? Multiple handlers accept different params.
- (d, e) Confirm whether DB is the source of truth for student/elective entities while courses remain TS/mocks until course tables exist.

## Next-Phase Checklist (to be used in Phase 2)

## Phase 4.2 — Curriculum Adapter Integration (2025-10-11)

Summary

- Added adapter layer `src/lib/schedule/curriculum-source.ts` mapping Supabase `swe_plan` to legacy `SWECurriculumLevel` used by scheduler.
- Mock fallback: When `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA === "true"`, adapter returns mock curriculum unchanged.
- Live mode: Fetches `swe_plan` by level, selects REQUIRED items, derives electiveSlots via static mapping, externalCourses via mock for now, and computes totalCredits.

Fallback conditions

- If live mode is enabled but no `swe_plan` data is present for a level, adapter still returns a valid empty structure with electiveSlots mapping and empty arrays.

Gate criteria for Phase 4.3 (Full Scheduler Link)

- Replace externalCourses source with DB-backed dataset.
- Extend adapter to include ELECTIVE type mapping for elective recommendations.
- Migrate remaining scheduler consumers to the async data path as needed.

---

## Phase 4.3 — Full Live Integration (2025-01-XX)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary

Complete removal of all mock data and full live Supabase integration with demo account seeding.

### Steps Completed

**Mock Data Removal:**

- ✅ Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA` conditional logic from all files
- ✅ Updated `ScheduleDataCollector` to fetch all data from Supabase
- ✅ Updated `curriculum-source.ts` to use live `swe_plan` table only
- ✅ Removed mock data seeding from `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Live Data Integration:**
- ✅ All `ScheduleDataCollector` methods now async and fetch from Supabase
- ✅ `getCurriculumForLevels()` → `swe_plan` table
- ✅ `getStudentsForLevels()` → `students` table  
- ✅ `getAvailableFaculty()` → `user` + `faculty_availability` tables
- ✅ `getAllElectiveCourses()` → `course` table
- ✅ `getExternalCourses()` → `external_course` table
- ✅ `getIrregularStudents()` → `irregular_student` table

**Demo Accounts System:**

- ✅ Updated `docs/main/DataFlow.md` to show live Supabase sources only
- ✅ Updated `docs/main/Migration.md` with Phase 4.3 demo accounts seed
- ✅ Updated `docs/main/Changelog.md` with v4.0.0 release
- ✅ Updated `PLAN.md` with Phase 4.3 completion status

### Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ No mock or fallback logic anywhere
- ✅ All data fetched from Supabase helpers
- ✅ Demo accounts live and accessible
- ✅ `/api/demo-accounts` working
- ✅ Documentation updated (6 files)
- ✅ Production build succeeds

### Next Phase: UI Handoff

**Ready for:** Frontend team to integrate with live data sources and demo accounts for testing.

- Student entities
  - Align SWEStudent ⇄ `students` (map ids, add email/major/gpa/credits to TS or adapters)
  - Add TS type for CompletedCourse ⇄ `completed_courses`
  - Confirm `student_profiles`/`student_submission_details` view field shapes and generate TS types
- Electives
  - Update `ElectivePreference` type or API adapters to include `package_id` and `submission_id` context
  - Validate dedupe constraints (student+course uniqueness within submission)
- Courses/Sections
  - Decide on persistence plan: add `course_offerings`, `sections` tables + `sections_view` or keep mock for now
  - Choose canonical time model (prefer numeric `SectionMeeting`); create migration plan to normalize
- Exams
  - Consolidate `ExamRecord` in `src/lib/committee-data-helpers.ts`; refactor UI imports later (no code change now)
- API
  - Implement missing `/api/schedule/generate`; define request/response types
  - Verify `/api/courses` and `/api/sections` Supabase dependencies exist or guard behind mock-only flags
- Data Flow
  - Extract listed inline transforms into helpers (`@/lib/committee-data-helpers`, `@/lib/student-schedule-helpers`, new electives helper)
- Tooling
  - Silence noisy console logs during build (move to debug logger)

## Data Flow & Helper Enforcement

Helper Modules Created

- `@/lib/elective-helpers.ts`
  - validateElectiveSubmissionPayload(payload)
  - buildSubmissionRow(studentUuid, submissionId, timestampISO)
  - buildPreferenceRows(submissionUuid, studentUuid, selections)
  - groupSelectionsByPackage(selections)
- `@/lib/student-helpers.ts`
  - toStudentProfileApi(row)

Transforms Relocated (from → to)

- `src/app/api/electives/submit/route.ts` (manual payload checks, row shaping) → `@/lib/elective-helpers` (validation + mapping)
- `src/app/api/student/profile/route.ts` (inline mapping of student view row) → `@/lib/student-helpers.toStudentProfileApi`

Validation Applied

- Zod: `electiveSubmissionPayloadSchema`, `dbElectiveSubmissionSchema`, `dbElectivePreferenceSchema`, `studentProfileViewSchema`, `dbStudentScheduleSchema`, `scheduleDataSchema`, `dbStudentSchema`, `dbCompletedCourseSchema`, `dbStudentFeedbackSchema`.
- APIs now call helpers that parse/validate before DB writes or response shaping.

Remaining Inline Logic (Phase 3 backlog)

- Committee scheduler UIs: grid aggregation, conflict grouping, reductions (`SchedulePreviewer.tsx`, `GeneratedScheduleResults.tsx`, `StudentCountsTable.tsx`). Suggested destination: `@/lib/committee-data-helpers` (existing) — add functions to cover observed inline transforms.
- Registrar capacity manager: totals and filters. Destination: `@/lib/committee-data-helpers`.
- Student electives pages: per-package credits and ranking transforms. Destination: `@/lib/student-schedule-helpers` or a new `@/lib/student-electives-helpers`.

Supabase MCP Confirmations

- Confirmed live tables: students, completed_courses, elective_submissions, elective_preferences, student_schedules (with JSONB), plus additional tables not in `supabase-schema.sql` like courses, sections, section_meetings (string time fields), and miscellaneous admin tables (workflow_states, schedule_versions, etc.).
- DB fields align with validators (notable: students.gpa is numeric/nullable — handled as string in TS and converted to number in helper for API output).

Ready-for-Phase-4 Checklist (Mock→Supabase Migration)

- Extend helpers to cover courses/sections once DB parity is finalized (currently mixed string vs numeric time models in DB vs TS).
- Update committee helpers to operate on DB-backed sources; add mappers to normalize section time model.
- Wire API routes `/api/courses`, `/api/sections` to use helper-based validation when DB tables/views are canonical.
- Add unit tests for helpers and zod schemas to prevent drift.

## Type & Schema Alignment

Tables parsed from `supabase-schema.sql` and canonical TypeScript interfaces/validators generated under `src/lib/types.ts` and `src/lib/validators/`.

### Field Diffs (TS ↔ DB)

- Student (TS: `DBStudent`) ↔ students

  - TS added: `user_id, student_id, email, major, gpa(string), completed_credits, total_credits, created_at, updated_at`
  - Diff vs old SWEStudent: SWEStudent was a separate view-model; keep both (view-model and DB model) distinct.

- CompletedCourse (TS: `DBCompletedCourse`) ↔ completed_courses

  - New TS type created; DB columns mapped 1:1. Nullable optional fields represented as `string | null` / `number | null`.

- ElectiveSubmission (TS: `DBElectiveSubmission`) ↔ elective_submissions

  - New TS type created; fields mirror DB.

- ElectivePreference (TS: `DBElectivePreference`) ↔ elective_preferences

  - TS now includes `submission_id` and `package_id`, aligning with DB. Original app type `ElectivePreference` remains for front-end but is not DB-aligned.

- StudentSchedule (TS: `DBStudentSchedule`) ↔ student_schedules

  - `schedule_data` typed as `unknown` and validated via `scheduleDataSchema` in `validators/schedules.ts`.

- StudentFeedback (TS: `DBStudentFeedback`) ↔ student_feedback

  - New TS type created; fields mirror DB.

- Views: student_profiles (TS: `StudentProfileView`), student_submission_details (TS: `StudentSubmissionDetailsView`)
  - TS types created to match view columns.

Missing DB tables referenced by API (⚠)

- `course_offerings`, `sections`/`sections_view` are referenced but not present in SQL. Types remain TS-only (`CourseOffering`, `Section`).

### Validators (Zod)

- `src/lib/validators/students.ts` — dbStudentSchema (✓)
- `src/lib/validators/completed-courses.ts` — dbCompletedCourseSchema (✓)
- `src/lib/validators/electives.ts` — dbElectiveSubmissionSchema, dbElectivePreferenceSchema, studentSubmissionDetailsViewSchema (✓)
- `src/lib/validators/feedback.ts` — dbStudentFeedbackSchema (✓)
- `src/lib/validators/schedules.ts` — dbStudentScheduleSchema, scheduleDataSchema for JSONB (✓)

### Validation Status

Entity | Validator | Status

- students | dbStudentSchema | ✓
- completed_courses | dbCompletedCourseSchema | ✓
- elective_submissions | dbElectiveSubmissionSchema | ✓
- elective_preferences | dbElectivePreferenceSchema | ✓
- student_schedules | dbStudentScheduleSchema + scheduleDataSchema | ✓ (JSON validated separately)
- student_feedback | dbStudentFeedbackSchema | ✓
- views student_profiles | — | ⚠ (Type created; validator optional)
- views student_submission_details | studentSubmissionDetailsViewSchema | ✓
- course_offerings/sections | — | ⚠ (no DB tables; TS-only)

### Clarifications Needed (Phase 2)

- Confirm target source for courses/sections: add `course_offerings` + `sections` tables, or keep TS-only until Phase 3. Affects API `/api/courses`, `/api/sections`.
- Student GPA representation: keep as text (DECIMAL to string) or cast to number in app? Currently typed as `string` to match DB.
- `student_feedback.category` enum values — should they be constrained? TS is free-form string; DB has comment only.
- For `student_schedules.schedule_data`, confirm canonical JSON schema (current `scheduleDataSchema` reflects existing `Schedule` interface).

### Ready-for-Phase-3 Checklist

- Switch API handlers to validate DB payloads using new zod schemas prior to use.
- Add validators for `CourseOffering` and `Section` once DB schema is introduced.
- Generate TS types from SQL (optionally via Supabase codegen) to prevent drift.

2. TS / Validator Drift

- students
  - gpa | TS: string (regex) | DB: numeric nullable | Status: Drift (nullable + numeric). TS assumes string always present; DB allows NULL.
  - completed_credits/total_credits | TS: number (nonnegative) | DB: int4 nullable with defaults | Status: Drift (nullable vs required).
  - created_at/updated_at | TS: string | DB: timestamptz nullable default now() | Status: OK (string timestamps acceptable) but nullable in DB.
- completed_courses
  - grade/semester/year | TS: optional nullable | DB: nullable | Status: OK
- elective_submissions
  - status | TS: string | DB: text nullable default 'submitted' | Status: Drift (nullable at DB).
  - submitted_at/created_at/updated_at | TS: string | DB: timestamptz nullable | Status: Drift (nullable at DB).
- elective_preferences
  - created_at | TS: string | DB: timestamptz nullable | Status: Drift (nullable at DB).
- student_schedules
  - schedule_data | TS: unknown + separate zod validator | DB: jsonb nullable | Status: OK (treat null as empty schema or validate when present)
  - generated_at/created_at/updated_at | TS: string | DB: timestamptz nullable | Status: Drift (nullable at DB).
- courses
  - types.ts doesn’t define a DB type; app uses `CourseOffering` (name, credits, department, level, type, prerequisites, exams, sections)
  - DB ‘courses’ columns: title (not name), optional level/type, no prerequisites/exams
  - Status: Drift (naming + missing fields). Addressed via mapping in `course-queries.ts` (no schema change planned now).
- sections / section_meetings
  - TS Section.times uses { day:string, start:string, end:string }; `SectionMeeting` uses numeric form (optional)
  - DB stores strings for day/startTime/endTime; mapping implemented; Status: OK (legacy string times preserved in API)
- student_feedback
  - TS validator expects: id, student_id, feedback_text, category, submitted_at, created_at
  - DB table present in MCP is a prototype with different columns (studentId, scheduleVersionId, feedbackType, content, status, createdAt/updatedAt)
  - Status: Drift (naming and shape). Marked Unstable.

3. Unstable / Pending Changes

- student_feedback table:
  - Not aligned with `DBStudentFeedback` and `dbStudentFeedbackSchema` (camelCase vs snake_case, field names differ). Expected to be redesigned to match validators.
- courses/sections/meetings time model:
  - `section_meetings.day/startTime/endTime` are strings; long-term plan is numeric normalization (`SectionMeeting`). Keep as-is for now; mapping layer stable.
- electives status values:
  - `elective_submissions.status` is free-form text; enum is TBD (e.g., submitted/processed/scheduled/cancelled). Keep string for now; document values.
- Workflow tables (workflow_states, schedule_versions, faculty_availability, teaching_assignments, student_counts, irregular_students):
  - Prototype tables with camelCase columns; not yet integrated into validators/types. Expected to evolve or be replaced in later phases.

4. Freeze-Readiness Checklist

- Decide nullable policy for timestamps and student numeric fields (gpa, completed_credits, total_credits) — Owner: DB/Schema.
- Confirm electives ‘status’ allowable values and whether to enforce enum — Owner: Product + DB.
- Confirm student_feedback table final shape (snake_case, field names) to match `dbStudentFeedbackSchema` — Owner: API + DB.
- Lock mapping for courses/title vs app name and document in API docs — Owner: API.
- Validate foreign keys coverage:
  - Ensure all referencing tables (sections → courses, meetings → sections, electives → students/submissions) have enforced FKs (present per MCP) — Owner: DB.
- Generate TS from DB or DB from TS (choose one as source-of-truth for Phase 5 docs) — Owner: Eng.

5. Notes

- External departments/courses are still partially mock-driven in UI; DB integration will follow after schema freeze.
- No schema edits were performed in this phase; this is documentation-only to prepare for freeze.

## Mock → Supabase Migration (Phase 4)

Summary

- Scope: Data-layer only (API routes, lib helpers). No UI or schema changes.
- Goal: Remove remaining mock/static sources for runtime data paths and rely on live Supabase tables/views.

Mock Data Sources to Replace

- Files providing mock data (still present, referenced primarily by UI/demo code):
  - `src/data/mockData.ts` (mockStudentCounts, mockElectivePackages, mockSWEIrregularStudents, mockCourseOfferings)
  - `src/data/mockSWECurriculum.ts`
  - `src/data/mockSWEStudents.ts`
  - `src/data/mockSWEFaculty.ts`
  - `src/data/mockRooms.ts`
  - `src/data/external-departments.json`
- In-memory helpers/services that operate on mocks:
  - `src/lib/local-state.ts` (initialization and reset from mockData)
  - `src/lib/data-store.ts` (Phase 3 in-memory collections and services)
  - `src/lib/seed-data.ts` (loads from mockData into in-memory store)

Mocks Replaced

- API: GET /api/courses
  - Replaced dependency on in-memory `courseOfferingService` (mockData seed) with Supabase reads via new helper.
- API: GET /api/sections
  - Replaced fallback flatten of `courseOfferingService.findAll().flatMap(...)` with Supabase reads via new helper.
- API: POST /api/auth/student
  - Removed `MOCK_STUDENTS` array. Now queries `students` and `completed_courses` (keeps response contract; simple password gate retained for demo parity).

Supabase Queries Added

- lib/course-queries.ts (NEW)
  - fetchCourseOfferingsFromDB():
    - SELECT from: courses, sections, section_meetings
    - Maps to `CourseOffering` shape (sections include legacy `times` array; exams placeholder maintained)
  - fetchSectionsFromDB():
    - SELECT from: courses (id, code), sections, section_meetings
    - Returns flattened `Section[]` with times mapped from meetings
- api/auth/student (POST):
  - SELECT students by `student_id` OR `email` (single)
  - SELECT completed_courses by `student_id` (UUID FK) and aggregate `course_code` list

Helpers Updated

- Introduced `src/lib/course-queries.ts` to encapsulate DB → App model mapping for courses/sections (reusable by other server routes/actions).
- api routes now import from `course-queries` instead of `data-store`/Supabase ad-hoc calls.

Validation Applied

- No schema changes; maintained existing `CourseOffering` and `Section` TS types.
- Input validation for auth remains minimal to preserve existing consumer contract; full Supabase Auth session is out-of-scope for this phase.
- Existing zod validators for electives/student profile remain unchanged and are still applied where relevant.

Remaining Non-Migrated

- lib/local-state.ts (holds mock-backed local in-memory state for exams/courses/studentCounts)
  - Still references `@/data/mockData` for initialization and reset; only used for client-side/demo flows.
- lib/data-store.ts and lib/seed-data.ts (Phase 3 in-memory + seeding)
  - Left intact for demo-only flows; no longer used by migrated API routes.
- Components importing mock data directly (demo/prototype UIs), e.g.:
  - student/electives/ElectiveSurvey.tsx → mockElectivePackages
  - committee/registrar/RegistrarCapacityManager.tsx → mockCourseOfferings
  - committee/scheduler/SectionEnrollmentManager.tsx → mockCourseOfferings, mockSWEStudents
  - committee/scheduler/irregular-students/IrregularStudentsViewer.tsx → mockSWEIrregularStudents
  - demo/\*\* pages with local mock arrays
  - These are UI-level and out-of-scope for Phase 4 (constraint: no UI edits).

Migrated Routes

- /api/courses → Supabase (tables: courses, sections, section_meetings).
- /api/sections → Supabase (tables: courses, sections, section_meetings).
- /api/auth/student → Supabase (tables: students, completed_courses) with a simple password check retained for compatibility.

Ready-for-Phase-5 Checklist (Doc Sync & Validation)

- Document DB→App mapping for CourseOffering/Section in docs/main/API.md and align examples.
- Add zod validators for `CourseOffering` and `Section` responses to prevent shape drift (optional but recommended).
- Replace any remaining server logic touching `lib/local-state.ts` with DB-backed queries; deprecate mock seeding in layout when NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA is false.
- Add minimal integration tests for /api/courses and /api/sections to assert shape and non-empty arrays when DB is populated.
- Evaluate moving exam data to a dedicated table/view and updating `course-queries` accordingly (no contract change needed immediately).

## UI-Driven Schema Discovery (Phase 4.6)

This section derives entities and fields directly from the current UI and API usage to guide schema finalization and adapter work. It complements the Schema Freeze prep by focusing on what the app actually needs at runtime.

### Proposed Data Model (UI-first)

Notes:

- P0 = critical for existing student and electives flows; P1 = near-term for schedule generation read/write; P2 = feedback/notifications; P3 = registrar/faculty prototypes.
- Courses/Sections exist in DB with slightly different names (title vs name; string time fields). Mapping layer is established in `lib/course-queries.ts`.

### Field Summaries (by Component)

- src/app/student/profile/page.tsx

  - Uses StudentProfile: studentId, name, email, level, major, gpa, completedCredits, totalCredits, completedCourses[] (codes).
  - Source: GET /api/student/profile.

- src/app/student/electives/page.tsx + components/student/electives/\*\*

  - Selection payload: studentId, selections[{ packageId, courseCode, priority }].
  - Course cards: code, name/title, credits, prerequisites[]; per-package totals; ranking priorities.
  - Source: POST /api/electives/submit; GET /api/courses.

- src/app/student/schedule/page.tsx

  - Placeholder; expects to load StudentSchedule by student and semester.
  - Source: future GET endpoint (e.g., /api/student/schedule?studentId=&semester=).

- src/app/student/feedback/page.tsx

  - Tracks feedback text and category (implicit); currently UI-only.
  - Target: POST /api/feedback.

- src/components/committee/registrar/RegistrarCapacityManager.tsx

  - Fields: courseCode, sectionId, baseCapacity, bufferPercent; new section draft: instructor, dayPattern, start, end, room, capacity.
  - Source: local/mock; target DB tables sections/section_meetings + capacity overrides.

- src/components/committee/registrar/RegistrarEnrollmentApproval.tsx

  - Fields: id, studentId, studentName, courseCode, sectionId, timestamp, status, reason.
  - Source: local-state; target enrollment_requests table.

- src/components/committee/faculty/availability/\*\*

  - Implicit weekly availability grid: day, start, end, available.
  - Source: local-state; DB prototype faculty_availability present.

- src/components/NotificationsDropdown.tsx
  - Displays list of notifications; expects id, title/body, created_at, read state.
  - Source: local/mock; target notifications table.

### Validators Missing (to add or confirm)

- CourseOffering and Section response validators (TS-only today) to lock API shapes.
- student_profiles view schema (optional validator for GET /api/student/profile).
- Notifications: dbNotificationSchema (id, recipient_id/role, type, title, body, created_at, read_at?).
- Registrar entities:
  - dbEnrollmentRequestSchema (id, student_id, course_code, section_id, status enum, reason?, created_at).
  - dbRegistrarCapacityOverrideSchema (id, section_id, buffer_percent, effective_from, effective_to?).
  - dbIrregularRequirementSchema (id, student_id, required_courses: string[]).
- Faculty prototypes: dbFacultyAvailabilitySchema, dbTeachingAssignmentSchema (if we wire UI to DB).
- Schedule generation contract:
  - scheduleGenerateRequestSchema (inputs for generator, e.g., semester, constraints flags).
  - scheduleGenerateResponseSchema (version id, snapshot diff, metadata).

### Schema Candidate Hints (DDL targets)

- notifications

  - Columns: id uuid PK, recipient_role text, recipient_id uuid NULL, type text, title text, body text, created_at timestamptz default now(), read_at timestamptz NULL.
  - Indexes: (recipient_role, created_at desc), (recipient_id) NULLS FIRST.

- enrollment_requests

  - Columns: id uuid PK, student_id uuid FK→students.id, course_code text, section_id text FK→sections.id, status text check in ('pending','approved','denied'), reason text NULL, created_at timestamptz default now(), decided_at timestamptz NULL, decided_by uuid NULL.
  - Unique (student_id, section_id) to prevent dup requests.

- registrar_capacity_overrides

  - Columns: id uuid PK, section_id text FK→sections.id, buffer_percent int not null check (buffer_percent between 0 and 100), effective_from timestamptz default now(), effective_to timestamptz NULL, created_by uuid NULL.
  - Derived effective capacity = baseCapacity \* (1 + buffer_percent/100.0).

- irregular_requirements

  - Columns: id uuid PK, student_id uuid FK→students.id, required_courses text[] not null, created_at timestamptz default now().

- student_feedback (align to validator)
  - Columns: id uuid PK, student_id uuid FK→students.id, feedback_text text not null, category text not null, submitted_at timestamptz default now(), created_at timestamptz default now().

### Next-Phase Checklist (for Schema Generation)

- P0

  - Implement /api/schedule/generate (wire to lib/schedule-generator.ts; persist to student_schedules; return version metadata). // PRD 4.2
  - Add validators for CourseOffering/Section responses and apply in /api/courses and /api/sections.
  - Ensure elective_preferences include package_id and submission linkage in adapters (already in DB; validate on write).

- P1

  - Create notifications table + /api/notifications (POST create, GET list by role/user).
  - Add GET /api/student/schedule with student_id and semester filters.
  - Add POST /api/feedback to write to aligned student_feedback table.

- P2

  - Introduce enrollment_requests table + /api/registrar/overrides (approve/deny) and /api/register (enforce capacity/conflicts + 25% registrar override).
  - Introduce registrar_capacity_overrides and apply in capacity calculations.
  - Optionally wire faculty_availability and teaching_assignments to UI pages.

- Cross-cutting
  - Generate TS types from SQL (codegen) or maintain Zod-first and derive SQL — pick one and document as source of truth.
  - Add RLS policies for new tables with role-based access.
  - Backfill mapping helpers in `@/lib/*-helpers.ts` to centralize transforms and prevent inline logic drift.

## UI/UX Major Enhancement

**Phase: 4.7.5 — UI/UX Refinement & Production Polish**  
**Completed: October 11, 2025**  
**Objective:** Unify the front-end for usability, responsiveness, accessibility, and design consistency using shadcn/ui primitives and TailwindCSS design tokens.

### Enhanced Components

#### Student Portal Pages

All student-facing pages received comprehensive UX upgrades:

   - ✅ Implemented multi-section skeleton loading
   - ✅ Added skeleton loaders for profile info items with proper spacing
   - ✅ Enhanced visual consistency with other pages

#### Global Components

6. **`/src/components/NotificationsDropdown.tsx`**
   - ✅ Replaced basic "No notifications" text with shadcn/ui Empty component
   - ✅ Added EmptyMedia with Bell icon for visual consistency
   - ✅ Improved empty state presentation within dropdown
   - ✅ Maintained existing badge and notification item styling

### Patterns Unified

#### Loading States

- **Before:** Inconsistent Loader2 spinners with varying sizes and placements
- **After:** Unified skeleton loaders using `<Skeleton />` component
  - Consistent skeleton sizing and spacing
  - Context-aware skeletons matching final UI structure
  - Improved perceived performance with progressive loading hints

#### Empty States

- **Before:** Basic text messages or centered divs
- **After:** Unified Empty component pattern
  - `<Empty>` container with proper spacing
  - `<EmptyHeader>` for title and description structure
  - `<EmptyMedia variant="icon">` for visual icons
  - `<EmptyTitle>` and `<EmptyDescription>` for consistent typography
  - Clear call-to-action buttons where appropriate

#### Button Consistency

- Standardized button sizing: `size="sm"`, `size="lg"` where contextually appropriate
- Consistent icon placement: icons on left for actions, right for navigation
- Proper disabled states with visual feedback

#### Form Elements

- Enhanced textarea with `resize-none` for better control
- Consistent label spacing and helper text styling
- Improved success/error feedback with color-coded alerts

### Accessibility Fixes

1. **Skeleton Loaders**

   - Skeletons provide visual feedback during data loading
   - Screen readers can still navigate page structure
   - Maintains layout stability (no content shift)

2. **Empty States**

   - Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
   - Icon + text combination for multiple sensory channels
   - Clear, actionable messaging

3. **Form Feedback**

   - Color-coded alerts (green for success) with icons
   - Text + icon combination (not color alone)
   - Proper contrast ratios maintained

4. **Button States**
   - Visible disabled states
   - Loading states communicated visually
   - Proper focus indicators (via shadcn/ui defaults)

### Feedback & Loading States

#### Added Components

- `<Skeleton />` - shadcn/ui skeleton component for loading states
- `<Empty />` - shadcn/ui empty state container
- `<EmptyHeader />`, `<EmptyTitle />`, `<EmptyDescription />`, `<EmptyMedia />` - empty state primitives
- `<Spinner />` - unified loading spinner component

#### Implementation Patterns

**Skeleton Loading Pattern:**

```tsx
// Comprehensive skeleton matching final UI structure
<div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8 max-w-7xl">
  <div className="mb-8">
    <Skeleton className="h-9 w-64 mb-2" />
    <Skeleton className="h-5 w-48" />
  </div>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
    {[1, 2, 3].map((i) => (
      <Card key={i}>
        <CardContent className="pt-6">
          <Skeleton className="h-12 w-12 mb-2" />
          <Skeleton className="h-8 w-32" />
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Empty State Pattern:**

```tsx
<Empty className="min-h-[500px]">
  <EmptyHeader>
    <EmptyMedia variant="icon">
      <Calendar className="h-8 w-8" />
    </EmptyMedia>
    <EmptyTitle>Schedule Not Available</EmptyTitle>
    <EmptyDescription>
      Clear explanation of why content is empty and what to do next
    </EmptyDescription>
  </EmptyHeader>
  <Button asChild size="lg">
    <Link href="/action">Take Action</Link>
  </Button>
</Empty>
```

**Success Feedback Pattern:**

```tsx
<Alert className="mb-4 border-green-200 bg-green-50 dark:border-green-800 dark:bg-green-950/20">
  <CheckCircle className="h-4 w-4 text-green-600 dark:text-green-400" />
  <AlertDescription className="text-green-900 dark:text-green-100">
    Success message with clear visual and semantic feedback
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```

### Visual Cohesion

#### Typography Standardization

- **Headings:** Consistent use of `text-3xl font-bold` for h1, `text-xl font-semibold` for h2
- **Body Text:** `text-base` for primary content, `text-sm` for secondary
- **Helper Text:** `text-xs text-muted-foreground` for hints and metadata

#### Spacing Normalization

- **Container Padding:** `px-4 py-8` standard for page containers
- **Card Spacing:** `gap-4` for card grids, `gap-6` for major sections
- **Vertical Rhythm:** `mb-2` for title-description pairs, `mb-8` for major sections

#### Color Consistency

- **Success States:** Green color family with proper dark mode support
  - `border-green-200 bg-green-50` (light)
  - `dark:border-green-800 dark:bg-green-950/20` (dark)
- **Interactive Elements:** Primary theme colors via shadcn/ui tokens
- **Muted Content:** `text-muted-foreground` for secondary information

#### Border & Shadow Harmony

- All components use shadcn/ui default border radius (consistent `rounded-lg`)
- Card shadows via shadcn/ui Card component (no custom shadows)
- Consistent border widths and colors via theme tokens

### Remaining UX Debt

#### P0 - Critical (Not Completed in This Phase)
