- Start with standard capacity (e.g., 50 students)
- Monitor enrollment rates
- Adjust capacity based on:
  - Room size
  - Faculty availability
  - Historical enrollment data

### Time Slot Management
- **Lecture sections:** 2-3 hours per week
- **Lab sections:** 2-3 hours in one block
- **Tutorial sections:** 1 hour per week
- Leave gaps between classes for travel time
- Consider student preferences for time slots

### Room Assignment
- Assign rooms based on:
  - Section capacity
  - Required equipment (labs, computers)
  - Accessibility requirements
- Leave room field empty if TBA (To Be Announced)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch courses"
**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify you're logged in

### Cannot delete section
**Reason:** Section has enrolled students
**Solution:**
- Cancel the section instead (set status to CANCELLED)
- Or wait until students are moved to other sections

### Conflict warnings after saving
**This is normal if:**
- Time slots overlap with other sections
- Instructor is double-booked
- Room is already reserved

**Actions:**
